# Nexum

>**Nexum** is a Data Structures Library for Rust, providing straightforward implementations of fundamental data structures. While some of these data structures might already be available in the [Rust Standard Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/), Nexum offers a convenient and easy-to-use alternative.
